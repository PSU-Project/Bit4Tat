INSTALLING
----------

Bit4Tat requires at least Java SE 5 or higher.  It also requires that the
appropriate environment variables are set to allow use of java and javac
without exact paths.

If both of these conditions are true, simply type 'make' (without quotes) from
the top level of the source tree.  A directory called /bin will be created
containing the class files.

To run, just run the bit4tat shell script.  This will use java to launch
the application.
